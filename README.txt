Video Note Taker!

What is the goal of this project?
--I want an easy way to take timestamped notes on videos. I should be able to pause at a timestamp and make a note. When I view the notes, I should be able to click on that note
and go to that timestamp automatically.

How am I building this?
--HTML/CSS/JS - Frontend
--Python (Django) - Backend
--Git - Version Control

What do I need to function?
--Ability to select videos
--Ability to create 'Notebooks' out of videos
--Ability to create 'Notes' under each video
--Ability to save 'Notebook' data
--Ability to save 'Notes'
--Things need to be saved ONLINE, not locally

What would be nice, but not necessary?
--Ability to create users so that the site can be used by people other than me.
--Ability for users to see and edit other users' Notebooks.
--Ability to set privacy settings/permissions on Notebooks (needed if there are users and Notebooks can be shared).
--Ability to export 'Notebooks' into easily readable, transportable formats (like PDF)
